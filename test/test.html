      console.log(Sediment.analyze("This is a genuinely good movie, it follows on from the previous Riddick movies and doesn't leave anything to be desired. Richard B Riddick is up to his old tricks again, and if you're a fan, you won't be disappointed, definitely a must see. Vin Diesel is great as always, playing a character that never ceases to enthral me, and the rest of the cast is great too. You know a movie is good when it makes you watch the previous movies when you get home from seeing it. The music is also exceptional I found too, fitting in very well with the action scenes. I've always found Riddick to be a movie that is very rich in its universe, it pulls you in without really telling you much, and this movie does exactly the same, worth a watch even if you're not a fan."));
